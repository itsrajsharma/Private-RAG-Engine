# Private-RAG-Engine
Private AI assistant for your documents.

Offline Knowledge Assistant is a fully offline, secure Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to allow users to upload local documents (PDF, DOCX) and interact with them using natural language queries. Without relying on any external APIs or internet connectivity, the system leverages locally hosted Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer questions based on the contents of the uploaded documents.

Users can ask questions about any part of the document—whether it’s summaries, specific sections, definitions, or detailed analysis—and receive contextually accurate responses in real-time. The system ensures full data privacy and is ideal for air-gapped environments, sensitive data handling, or enterprise use cases where external data sharing is not allowed.
